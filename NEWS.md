# glydet (development version)

# glydet 0.6.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Updated dependency on `glymotif (>= 0.10.0)` to ensure compatibility with recent changes in package `igraph v2.2.0`.

# glydet 0.6.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Add `alignments` and `ignore_linkages` parameters to `quantify_motifs()`. These two parameters were left behind when we migrated `quantify_motifs()` from `glymotif` to `glydet` in glydet 0.6.0.

# glydet 0.6.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Fix bugs introduced by the breaking changes in `glyexp` 0.10.0.

# glydet 0.6.0

## Breaking changes

* The first parameter of `wmean()` is renamed from `val_cond` to `val`.
* The built-in trait `SG` is renamed to `GS`, and `GA` to `AG`, to match the convention that the last element of a trait name should be the focused property.

## New features

* Add two new trait factories: `total()` and `wsum()`.
* Add `quantify_motifs()`. This function was once in the `glymotif` package, but we realized that motif quantification is essentially a special case of derived traits, so we reimplemented it in `glydet` with a more consistent and powerful interface.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Fix some improperly named traits in the "Defining Custom Traits" vignette.
* Fix an error in a code snippet in the "Defining Custom Traits" vignette: `prop(nFc + nFa > 0)` -> `prop((nFc + nFa) > 0)`.
* Add a vignette about quantifying glycan motifs.
* Update the introduction part in the "Get Started with glydet" vignette.
* All trait factories now have a `glydet_trait` super class.

# glydet 0.5.0

## Breaking changes

* The meta-property `T` is renamed to `Tp`, to avoid confusion with the R alias `T` for `TRUE`.

## New features

* Add `mp_cols` parameter to `derive_traits()` as a new way to define custom meta-properties.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* `derive_traits()` and `derive_traits_()` now have separate documentations.
* Update the "Defining Custom Traits" vignette to include the newly added `mp_cols` parameter.
* Better error message when custom derived traits use undefined meta-properties.
* Add a section about how NAs can appear in the documentations of `prop()`, `ratio()`, and `wmean()`.

# glydet 0.4.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Add another example to the "Defining Custom Traits" vignette.
* Use smaller datasets in examples to reduce build time.

# glydet 0.4.0

## Breaking changes

* The old `all_traits()` is renamed to `basic_traits()`.
* A new `all_traits()` is added, which includes more advanced derived traits with more detailed `within` conditions.
* `derive_traits()` now uses `basic_traits()` by default.
* `derive_traits()` now returns a `glyexp::experiment()` object with the "traitomics" type for glycomics data, and "traitproteomics" type for glycoproteomics data, instead of "traitomics" for all input.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Introduce the new `all_traits()` in the Get Started vignette.
* Add examples to some functions.

# glydet 0.3.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Add `missForest` to the Suggests field in DESCRIPTION. This package is used in vignettes to impute missing values for glycomics data.

# glydet 0.3.0

## New features

* Trait functions created by `prop()`, `ratio()`, and `wmean()` can be printed nicely into the console.
* Add `explain_trait()` to provide a human-readable explanation of trait definitions.
* Add a `nF` built-in meta-property to count the number of fucoses. The `TF` trait is redefined as `prop(nF > 0)`.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Emphasize in the documentation of `derive_traits()` and `derive_traits_()` that the "glycan_structure" column can be either a `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` vector or a character vector of glycan structure strings supported by `glyparse::auto_parse()`.
* `derive_traits()` and `derive_traits_()` now raise an error if the `trait_fns` parameter is not a named list.
* `derive_traits()` and `derive_traits_()` now raise an error if the `trait_fns` parameter is an empty list.
* A "Working with Glycomics Data" section is added to the "Get Started" vignette.
* A "Validating Trait Definitions" section is added to the "Defining Custom Traits" vignette.

# glydet 0.2.0

## New features

* `derive_traits()` and `add_meta_properties()` now validates if the `struc_col` column exists.
* Add an `overwrite` parameter to `add_meta_properties()` to deal with existing trait columns.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Fix a serious bug in `derive_traits()`, where the row names of the expression matrix were not set correctly for glycomics data.
* Fix typos in documentations.

# glydet 0.1.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Update dependencies to depend on release versions of glycoverse packages.

# glydet 0.1.0

* First release.
