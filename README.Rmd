The goal of glydet is to describe glycosylation structural properties in a site specific manner.
In the field of glycomics, this analytical approach is known as derived traits.
glydet provides functions to calculate derived traits well-defined in literature,
and implements a domain-specific language to define custom derived traits.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glydet from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glydet@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glydet")
```

## Role in `glycoverse`

glydet is a high-level package in the `glycoverse` ecosystem.
It is designed to be used by glycomics or glycoproteomics researchers directly to calculate derived traits.
It is built on top of many other packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem,
including `glyexp`, `glyrepr`, `glyparse`, and `glymotif`.

## Example

First, let's load necessary packages and get the data ready.

```{r}
library(glyexp)
library(glyclean)
library(glydet)

exp <- auto_clean(real_experiment)
exp
```

Now, let's calculate some derived traits!

```{r}
trait_exp <- derive_traits(exp)
trait_exp
```

VoilÃ ! What you see is a brand new `experiment()` object with "traitomics" type.
Think of it as your original dataset's sophisticated cousin ðŸŽ­ â€”
instead of tracking "quantification of each glycan on each glycosite in each sample,"
it now contains "the value of each derived trait on each glycosite in each sample."

```{r}
get_var_info(trait_exp)
```

```{r}
get_expr_mat(trait_exp)[1:5, 1:5]
```
