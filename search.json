Let’s take quick peek dataset understand ’re working : Now magic moment ✨—let’s calculate derived traits! Voilà! see brand new experiment() object “traitomics” type. Think original dataset’s sophisticated cousin 🎭 — instead tracking “quantification glycan glycosite sample,” now contains “value derived trait glycosite sample.” 🎉 Congratulations! ’ve just calculated comprehensive suite derived traits site-specific manner: TM: Proportion high-mannose glycans TH: Proportion hybrid glycans TC: Proportion complex glycans MM: Average number mannoses within high-mannose glycans CA2: Proportion bi-antennary glycans within complex glycans CA3: Proportion tri-antennary glycans within complex glycans CA4: Proportion tetra-antennary glycans within complex glycans TF: Proportion fucosylated glycans TFc: Proportion core-fucosylated glycans TFa: Proportion arm-fucosylated glycans TB: Proportion glycans bisecting GlcNAc GS: Average degree sialylation per galactose AG: Average degree galactosylation per antenna TS: Proportion sialylated glycans 💡 key insight: treat glycans glycosite separate mini-glycome, calculate derived traits one across samples. instance, particular glycosite hosts 10 different glycans, TFc value represents proportion core-fucosylated glycans within 10 structures sample. Important Note: built-derived traits work N-glycans. types glycans, need define derived traits. Check Defining Custom Traits vignette learn define derived traits. fact, types glycans complex N-glycans, e.g. O-glycans, recommend using motif quantification instead. Now comes fun part! 📊 can leverage powerful functions glystats package analyze derived traits.
