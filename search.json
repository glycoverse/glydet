Let’s demonstrate ANOVA analysis identify glycosites significantly different levels core-fucosylation across conditions: 🔍 Discovery time! ’ve identified several glycosites statistically significant differences core-fucosylation levels across patient groups — exactly kind biological insights make derived traits powerful!","code":"exp <- auto_clean(real_experiment)  # Preprocess the data #> ℹ Normalizing data (Median) #> ✔ Normalizing data (Median) [139ms] #>  #> ℹ Removing variables with >50% missing values #> ✔ Removing variables with >50% missing values [76ms] #>  #> ℹ Imputing missing values #> ℹ Sample size <= 30, using sample minimum imputation #> ℹ Imputing missing values✔ Imputing missing values [25ms] #>  #> ℹ Aggregating data #> ✔ Aggregating data [906ms] #>  #> ℹ Normalizing data again #> ✔ Normalizing data again [20ms] exp #>  #> ── Experiment ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── #> ℹ Expression matrix: 12 samples, 3880 variables #> ℹ Sample information fields: group <chr> #> ℹ Variable information fields: protein <chr>, gene <chr>, glycan_composition <comp>, glycan_structure <struct>, protein_site <int> get_var_info(exp) #> # A tibble: 3,880 × 6 #>    variable protein gene     glycan_composition      #>    <chr>    <chr>   <chr>    <comp>                  #>  1 V1       P08185  SERPINA6 Hex(5)HexNAc(4)NeuAc(2) #>  2 V2       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)NeuAc(1) #>  3 V3       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)         #>  4 V4       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)NeuAc(1) #>  5 V5       P10909  CLU      Hex(6)HexNAc(5)         #>  6 V6       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)NeuAc(2) #>  7 V7       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)         #>  8 V8       P04196  HRG      Hex(5)HexNAc(4)dHex(2)  #>  9 V9       P04196  HRG      Hex(4)HexNAc(3)         #> 10 V10      P04196  HRG      Hex(4)HexNAc(4)NeuAc(1) #> # ℹ 3,870 more rows #> # ℹ 2 more variables: glycan_structure <struct>, protein_site <int> get_sample_info(exp) #> # A tibble: 12 × 2 #>    sample group #>    <chr>  <chr> #>  1 C1     C     #>  2 C2     C     #>  3 C3     C     #>  4 H1     H     #>  5 H2     H     #>  6 H3     H     #>  7 M1     M     #>  8 M2     M     #>  9 M3     M     #> 10 Y1     Y     #> 11 Y2     Y     #> 12 Y3     Y get_expr_mat(exp)[1:5, 1:5] #>              C1           C2           C3           H1           H2 #> V1 6.626760e+03 2.019159e+04      13432.7 4.072473e+04 1.771879e+04 #> V2 3.744595e+08 5.691652e+08   99531624.5 2.372164e+04 1.422307e+07 #> V3 5.260619e+08 5.644547e+08  211645556.7 9.149818e+08 8.534716e+08 #> V4 2.983928e+09 2.665752e+09 1207235166.5 3.410355e+09 3.918161e+09 #> V5 2.751569e+07 3.200443e+07    8055532.6 6.765746e+07 4.546455e+07 trait_exp <- derive_traits(exp) trait_exp #>  #> ── Experiment ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── #> ℹ Expression matrix: 12 samples, 3836 variables #> ℹ Sample information fields: group <chr> #> ℹ Variable information fields: protein <chr>, protein_site <int>, trait <chr>, gene <chr> get_var_info(trait_exp) #> # A tibble: 3,836 × 5 #>    variable protein protein_site trait gene  #>    <chr>    <chr>          <int> <chr> <chr> #>  1 V1       A6NJW9            49 TM    CD8B2 #>  2 V2       A6NJW9            49 TH    CD8B2 #>  3 V3       A6NJW9            49 TC    CD8B2 #>  4 V4       A6NJW9            49 MM    CD8B2 #>  5 V5       A6NJW9            49 CA2   CD8B2 #>  6 V6       A6NJW9            49 CA3   CD8B2 #>  7 V7       A6NJW9            49 CA4   CD8B2 #>  8 V8       A6NJW9            49 TF    CD8B2 #>  9 V9       A6NJW9            49 TFc   CD8B2 #> 10 V10      A6NJW9            49 TFa   CD8B2 #> # ℹ 3,826 more rows # These are the trait values!
