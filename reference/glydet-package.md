# glydet: Describe Glycosylation Structural Properties in a Site Specific Manner

Calculate and analyze glycosylation derived traits for site-specific
glycoproteomics data. Derived traits are summary features that aggregate
individual glycan abundances into biologically meaningful groups (e.g.,
galactosylation, sialylation, fucosylation, branching). This package
provides functions to compute well-established derived traits from the
literature, and features a domain-specific language for defining custom
derived traits tailored to specific research needs.
