\title{Explain a Derived Trait}
\usage{
explain_trait(trait_fn, use_ai = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_fn}{A derived trait function created by one of the trait factories.}

\item{use_ai}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}
Whether to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to explain the trait. Default is FALSE.
To use this feature, you need to install the \code{ellmer} package.
You also need to provide an API key for the DeepSeek chat model.
Please set the environment variable \code{DEEPSEEK_API_KEY} to your API key.
You can obtain an API key from https://platform.deepseek.com.}
}
\value{
A character string containing a concise English explanation of the trait.
}
\description{
This function provides a human-readable English explanation of what a derived trait represents.
It works with trait functions created by the trait factories \code{\link[=prop]{prop()}}, \code{\link[=ratio]{ratio()}}, \code{\link[=wmean]{wmean()}},
\code{\link[=total]{total()}}, and \code{\link[=wsum]{wsum()}}, and works best with traits defined by built-in meta-properties.
}
\examples{
# Explain built-in traits
explain_trait(basic_traits()$TM)
explain_trait(basic_traits()$GS)

# Explain custom traits
explain_trait(prop(nFc > 0))
explain_trait(prop(nFc > 0, within = (Tp == "complex")))
explain_trait(ratio(Tp == "complex", Tp == "hybrid"))
explain_trait(wmean(nA, within = (Tp == "complex")))
explain_trait(wmean(nS / nG, within = nA == 4 & nFc > 0))

# Explain total and wsum traits
explain_trait(total(Tp == "complex"))
explain_trait(wsum(nS))
explain_trait(wsum(nS, within = (Tp == "complex")))

}
