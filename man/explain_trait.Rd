\title{Explain a Derived Trait}
\usage{
explain_trait(trait_fn)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_fn}{A derived trait function created by one of the trait factories.}
}
\value{
A character string containing a concise English explanation of the trait.
}
\description{
This function provides a human-readable English explanation of what a derived trait represents.
It works with trait functions created by the trait factories \code{\link[=prop]{prop()}}, \code{\link[=ratio]{ratio()}}, and \code{\link[=wmean]{wmean()}},
and works best with traits defined by built-in meta-properties.
}
\examples{
# Explain built-in traits
explain_trait(basic_traits()$TM)
explain_trait(basic_traits()$SG)

# Explain custom traits
explain_trait(prop(nFc > 0))
explain_trait(prop(nFc > 0, within = (T == "complex")))
explain_trait(ratio(T == "complex", T == "hybrid"))
explain_trait(wmean(nA, within = (T == "complex")))
explain_trait(wmean(nS / nG, within = nA == 4 & nFc > 0))
