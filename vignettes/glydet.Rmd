🧬 N-glycans are among nature's most fascinating molecular structures—ubiquitous
yet highly constrained by strict biosynthesis rules.
This structural discipline creates a unique opportunity:
we can describe entire N-glycomes using carefully designed variables,
such as the proportion of core-fucosylated glycans,
the fraction of sialylated structures,
or the average degree of sialylation per galactose.

In the N-glycomics world,
these descriptive variables are known as **"derived traits"** —
powerful summaries that capture biological meaning far beyond simple glycan abundances 
(the so-called "direct traits").

Enter `glydet` 🚀—your toolkit for calculating derived traits with unprecedented precision.
But here's where it gets exciting:
`glydet` brings the power of derived traits to the glycoproteomics community for the first time,
enabling **site-specific trait analysis**.
Plus, it features an intuitive domain-specific language that lets you define custom traits tailored to your research needs.

**Important Note:** This package is built on the [glyrepr](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyrepr) package,
and heavily relies on the [glyexp](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyexp) package.
If you are not familiar with these two packages,
we highly recommend checking out their introductions first.

```{r setup}
library(glydet)
library(glyrepr)
library(glyexp)
library(glyclean)
library(glystats)
```

## 🎯 Dive Right In: Your First Analysis

Ready to see `glydet` in action?
Let's jump straight into a real-world example that demonstrates its power!
We'll work with `glyexp::real_experiment` — 
an authentic N-glycoproteomics dataset from 12 patients with varying liver conditions. 

⚠️ **Pro tip:** Always preprocess your data with `glyclean` before diving into trait analysis.
This ensures your results are as clean and reliable as your data!

```{r}
exp <- auto_clean(real_experiment)  # Preprocess the data
exp
```

Let's take a quick peek at our dataset to understand what we're working with:

```{r}
get_var_info(exp)
```

```{r}
get_sample_info(exp)
```

```{r}
get_expr_mat(exp)[1:5, 1:5]
```

Now for the magic moment ✨—let's calculate some derived traits!

```{r}
trait_exp <- derive_traits(exp)
trait_exp
```

Voilà! What you see is a brand new `experiment()` object with "traitomics" type.
Think of it as your original dataset's sophisticated cousin 🎭 —
instead of tracking "quantification of each glycan on each glycosite in each sample,"
it now contains "the value of each derived trait on each glycosite in each sample."

```{r}
get_var_info(trait_exp)
```

```{r}
# These are the trait values!
get_expr_mat(trait_exp)[1:5, 1:5]
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've just calculated a comprehensive suite of derived traits in a site-specific manner:

- **`TM`**: Proportion of high-mannose glycans
- **`TH`**: Proportion of hybrid glycans  
- **`TC`**: Proportion of complex glycans
- **`MM`**: Average number of mannoses within high-mannose glycans
- **`CA2`**: Proportion of bi-antennary glycans within complex glycans
- **`CA3`**: Proportion of tri-antennary glycans within complex glycans
- **`CA4`**: Proportion of tetra-antennary glycans within complex glycans
- **`TF`**: Proportion of fucosylated glycans
- **`TFc`**: Proportion of core-fucosylated glycans
- **`TFa`**: Proportion of arm-fucosylated glycans
- **`TB`**: Proportion of glycans with bisecting GlcNAc
- **`SG`**: Average degree of sialylation per galactose
- **`GA`**: Average degree of galactosylation per antenna
- **`TS`**: Proportion of sialylated glycans

💡 **The key insight:** We treat the glycans on each glycosite as a separate mini-glycome,
then calculate derived traits for each one across all samples.
For instance, if a particular glycosite hosts 10 different glycans,
the `TFc` value represents the proportion of core-fucosylated glycans within those 10 structures in each sample.

Now comes the fun part!
📊 You can leverage all the powerful functions in the `glystats` package to analyze your derived traits.
Let's demonstrate with an ANOVA analysis to identify glycosites with significantly different levels of core-fucosylation across conditions:

```{r}
anova_res <- gly_anova(trait_exp)
anova_res$tidy_result$main_test |>
  dplyr::filter(trait == "TFc", p_adj < 0.05)
```

🔍 **Discovery time!** We've identified several glycosites with statistically significant differences
in core-fucosylation levels across our patient groups —
exactly the kind of biological insights that make derived traits so powerful!

## 🔧 Under the Hood: Understanding Meta-Properties

Curious about how the magic happens?
Let's lift the hood and explore `glydet`'s inner workings—but don't worry,
we'll keep things accessible! 

The key concept you need to understand is **"meta-properties"** -
think of them as the molecular fingerprints of individual glycans.

🆚 **What's the difference?**

- **Derived traits** describe entire glycomes (or all glycans on a glycosite) and their values fluctuate across samples
- **Meta-properties** describe individual glycans regardless of their abundance —
like counting antennae,core fucoses, or sialic acids on a single structure

🧠 **The connection:** Meta-properties are the building blocks for derived traits.
When you call `derive_traits()`,
`glydet` automatically calculates meta-properties for all glycans first,
then uses this information to compute the derived traits you see.

Want to work with meta-properties directly? 🛠️ You're in luck! `glydet` provides two handy functions:

- **`get_meta_properties()`**: Calculate meta-properties for any set of glycans
- **`add_meta_properties()`**: Enrich your `experiment()` object by adding meta-properties to variable information

### 🔬 get_meta_properties()

Let's see `get_meta_properties()` in action!
We'll extract a few glycan structures from our dataset:

```{r}
glycans <- unique(get_var_info(exp)$glycan_structure)[1:5]
glycans
```

📝 **Note:** `glycans` is a `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` vector—these are standardized representations of glycan structures.

Now watch the magic happen as we calculate their meta-properties:

```{r}
get_meta_properties(glycans)
```

### 📈 add_meta_properties()

Working with `glyexp::experiment()` objects? Perfect!
You can supercharge your variable information by adding meta-properties directly:

```{r}
exp_with_mp <- add_meta_properties(exp)
get_var_info(exp_with_mp)
```

✨ **Look at that transformation!** Your variable information is now enriched with multiple meta-property columns.
This opens up powerful filtering possibilities based on structural features. 

For instance, let's filter for all glycoforms containing high-mannose glycans:

```{r}
exp_with_mp |>
  filter_var(T == "highmannose")
```

### 🧰 Meta-Property Functions: Your Structural Toolkit

Behind the scenes, meta-properties are actually functions that take `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` vectors
and return corresponding property values.
`glydet` comes packed with a comprehensive library of built-in meta-property functions:

```{r}
names(all_mp_fns())
```

📚 **Your complete toolkit:** Here's the full roster of built-in meta-property functions:

| Name | Function | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `T` | `n_glycan_type()` | Type of the glycan, either "complex", "hybrid", "highmannose", or "pausimannose" |
| `B` | `has_bisecting()` | Whether the glycan has a bisecting GlcNAc |
| `nA` | `n_antennae()` | Number of antennae |
| `nFc` | `n_core_fuc()` | Number of core fucoses |
| `nFa` | `n_arm_fuc()` | Number of arm fucoses |
| `nG` | `n_gal()` | Number of galactoses |
| `nGt` | `n_terminal_gal()` | Number of terminal galactoses |
| `nS` | `n_sia()` | Number of sialic acids |
| `nM` | `n_man()` | Number of mannoses |

Each function can be called directly for quick structural analysis:

```{r}
n_glycan_type(glycans)
```
